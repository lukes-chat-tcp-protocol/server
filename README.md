# Chat TCP Protocol

## Description
A TCP protocol I made to build a chat program.

## Notes
* The format of sending any request is the method a space and then all payloads seperated with spaces.
* Whenever sending payload, it is always going to be sent encoded with Base64 to allow all characters in payload, except for error messages.
* The methods and modes are uppercase to show they are commands while talking about it in chat.
* Permission level can range between 1 and 4
* The mode FROM_TELNET does not send any response back to the server as if it is in telnet mode, it is meant to be read by humans.
